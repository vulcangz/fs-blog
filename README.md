# FS-Blog - A Modern Fullstack Dev.to Style Multi-user blog

Built with Go FastSchema, Next.js App Router + NextAuth.js v5 and Chakra UI.

## Why

FastSchema is a No-Code Headless CMS, with built-in features: Admin Control Panel, File manger, OAS, RBAC, and more. But so far, I haven't found a good enough web front end to showcase its rich functionality. Because "Next.js has everything you need to build great products on the web.", so let me try...

Thanks to the dev.to clone repository on GitHub for giving me the courage to try it.

> **Note:** Please note that this is only an experimental demo system. The backend is basically stable, and the frontend is still iterating... 

The code was written for this articles : [(1)](https://www.worldlink.com.cn/post/build-a-devto-style-multi-user-blog-with-fastschema-nextjs-nextauth-v5-and-chakra-ui.html), [(2)](https://www.worldlink.com.cn/post/build-a-devto-style-multi-user-blog-with-fastschema-nextjs-nextauth-v5-and-chakra-ui-2-design%20and%20realization).
